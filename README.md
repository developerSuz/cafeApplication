Description
</p><br>
<p>This is an application to allow the manager of a social enterprise cafe to update a list of products for sale with ease and speed on a daily basis.  As the cafe is a social enterprise it has unusual opening hours, sometime only for 1 or 2 hours per day, not at weekends and closed for extended holiday periods throughout the year.  For this reason it is important that the populating of the list of products for sale can be added to and edited with ease and in a minimal amount of time</p>
<p>It is possible to "untick" a product for sale with ease, eg milkshake is only sold on a Friday, so as it can be unticked, removing it from products for sale, it can be speedily added the following week.</p>
<p>May be installed as a PWA.</p>
<p>Front end app has been created with React, and server-side authentication is provided by Laravel Breeze for the manager to register / login / update profile</p>
<p>It is important to note that this app will be developed further than what was asked for.  It is at this stage to demonstrate enhanced features of devloping with React, particularly in regards to improved webcam usage and geolocation services, the app works out the nearest cafe for example.  This app makes up phase 1 of the development for which the next steps are to allow the manager to click "OpenCafe" and a notification will be sent to user apps to let them know it is open for orders.  A customer view will be created to allow server side ordering.  The manager will also be able to "Close" the cafe to prevent further orders being placed when closed.</p>

<p>Installation Guidelines</p>
<br>
<p>I developed locally, using Visual Studio Code, and in the terminal entered:</p>
<ul>
    <li>run mpm dev</li>
    <li>php artisan serve</li>
</ul>
<p> To run the node server and php artisan server.  I used xampp to run an Apache server and MySQL using phpMyAdmin for server side administration</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
